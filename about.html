        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
        <p>
            Amelia "HALOHOLIC" is an artist originally from the Mid-Atlantic region in the United States,
            and currently conducts her practices in the Greater Bristol area
            of England. She has been participating in freelance work since
            2020, while gradually persuing her AAS in Full Stack Web Development
            and eventually her BS in Web and Digital Design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amelia is self-taught in her field [of art] and continually strives
            for improvement with her craftsmanship and her morals. Her current
            participation in personal works include illustrations for her comic,
            "Nycto Investigation Agency", as well as many forms of character design and
            general commission work.
        </p>

        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Something I dare to emphasize in a lot of my illustrations is the imperfections of life itself.
            As an artist, I try to often embrace and incorporate flaws--I want what themes towards the character the
            most,
            creating fluidity between the style of the piece and what its characteristics are.
            I grew up not always liking something about me, whether that is my appearance, or how I did something, or
            how
            I came off to people. This aspect was especially significant in my art-- I grew up pointing out the
            imperfections and what I thought was "horrible." Growing more comfortable with myself and who I actually
            am, I have started to embrace my flaws and turn them into something I think is beautiful and can be admired.
            This aspect I love reflecting in my art now--every line or stroke will never be linear or perfect, but
            come together with other strokes and lines to create an illustration I can rightfully call my own!
        </p>
        <p>
            Becoming more independent with my name and style of artwork, I often recreate a more "painted" feel to
            what I work with. I also enjoy dabbling into other kinds of artwork, from modern branding to character
            design and linework. Any of the artwork I create, I love to consider what purpose it'd serve once completed,
            and ultimately I find that creating a diverse, colorful environment with my art style separates my artwork
            and brand from other artists.
        </p>
